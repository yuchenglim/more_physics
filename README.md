# More Physics: how to self-study anything

The hardest part of studying is that it is a slow painful process. But a slight change in attitude can save you: if you can do 5 pages of calculations a day, even if it is just 5 pages, you realize your file gets thicker and thicker. Use the evening to take stock of what you've done and witness your own progress. After a week that's 35 pages :)

Somehow knowing that I am progressing little by little gives me a bit more energy to push a little further. What about you?

The most important thing about learning English, Malay and Chinese is to pick a book and read. Diversify your readings. Get a reading list. For ideas, search for summer reading lists and you'll realize how little we know, and how much other kids in, say the US, are doing.

Same applies to physics and mathematics.

I actually ended up reading Griffiths, Purcell, Jackson, Vanderlinde, Bottcher and more, just to learn EM.... Anyway. Enjoy reading!
